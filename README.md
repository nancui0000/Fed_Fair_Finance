# CRAFT Project: Advanced Fairness-aware Federated Learning for Financial Risk Assessment

The objective of this project is to study and design new federated learning techniques to preserve privacy and improve fairness 
in machine learning applications in financial domains. Financial data are generally distributed which means different financial
entities save their own data locally and do not share data for learning purposes. However, machine learning algorithms benefit 
from learning large-scale datasets that cover diverse distributions. Thus, federated learning has become a popular architecture 
for distributed learning where data are saved locally. The goal of federated learning is to be able to harness data without a 
third party ever directly interacting with the data, thus ensuring usersâ€™ data remain secure. We will study federated learning 
algorithms for heterogeneous data with fairness constraints. We will design new dynamic and adaptive strategies for parameter sharing 
to handle heterogeneous financial data distributions. To guarantee different clients receive fair predictions, we will develop random
matrix-based aggregation methods to prevent privacy leaking in fairness-constrained federated learning.
